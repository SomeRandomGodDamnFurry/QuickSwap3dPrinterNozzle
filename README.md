# QuickSwap3dPrinterNozzle

This repository may eventually hold models and such.
For now, its just a gif and an explaination of the idea.

Basically, if we hold the nozzle of the printer in with a clip instead of a screw, it can allow much easier nozzle removal.

This design also only requires slight modification to allow it to work with a button instead of a removable clip.

If I ever get around to it, I'll make and release the button version.

Its pretty similar in it uses a metal peice to lock into part of the nozzle. The metal just gets pushed out of the way and reset via a spring.
